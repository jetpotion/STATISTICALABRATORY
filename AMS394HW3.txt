logret<- read.table("d_logret_6stocks.txt",header=T)
t.test(logret$Intel,mu = 0 )
##From the test it seems the P value is greater than 0.05 because 0.4829 > 0.05 
##Thus we dont reject the null hypothesis and will accept it.
#Therefore the mean returns is zero


wilcox.test(logret$Intel,mu = 0,paired = F)
###The P value is 0.8279 thus we dont reject  the null hypothesis because 0.8279 > 0.05
###The result is no different than the T-Test where he conclude the mean return is zero

t.test(logret$Intel,logret$Pfizer)
###The P value for this test 0.8287.We cannot reject the null hypothesis
### Thus the reutrn  difference does equal to zero.(Thus no change) 
###Thus there is no difference between the 2 data

wilcox.test(logret$Intel, logret$Pfizer,paired  = F)
###The p value of this test 0.892. We cannot reject null hypothesis. 
#Again location shift is equal to 0
###Thus there is no difference between the 2 data

var.test(logret$Intel,logret$Pfizer)
##We test the variance of the returns and the P value is extremely small.
##Thus we can reject the null hypothesis. The variances of each return are not equal 

##Problem 2
##Put the rats into seperate containers
degree1 = c(152,157,179,185,178,149)
degree2 = c(384,369,354,367,375,423)
##These rats while the same are put in 2 different enviroment 
##but thefore not a paired data set. So we take their data as indepdent 
shapiro.test(degree1)
#P value confirms they are normal
shapiro.test(degree2)
##We can conclude both data is normal 
var.test(degree1,degree2)
###We can conclude the variances are equal
t.test(degree2,degree1, alternative = "greater",var.equal =  T)

### The P value is way too small.We will reject null hypothesis 
##We will claim that that the mean blood pressure of the rats exposed to 5 degree celsius is greater than  the ones exposed at  26




##Problem 3 
###Put the data into containers 
eyeaffected  <- c (488,478,480,426,440,410,458,460)
eyenotaffected <- c(484,478,492,444,436,398,464,476)
###The data is not broken into 2 populations we can automatically assume they paired data.
###Now we must test their differnece 
diff = eyeaffected - eyenotaffected
shapiro.test(diff)
###The P value 0.3018 is greater than  0.10 thus we must accept that the difference are normal 
t.test(eyeaffected,eyenotaffected,paired = T,conf.level =   0.9)
### Due to this T test, the P value is greater than 0.1.Thus we cannot reject null hypothesis.
###The difference in means is equal to zero.Thus we can conclude the eye affected
### eye not affected and eye affected  mean data is equal(thus no differnece)

t.test(diff,mu = 0, conf.level =  0.9) 
###The P value is way larger than 0.1 thus we can reject null hypothesis 
###Conclude there is no difference in data 

###Problem 4
data  <- c(28, 25, 27, 31, 10, 26, 30, 15, 55, 12, 24, 32, 28, 42, 38)
###The data is single line
shapiro.test(data)

##The data has a P value of 0.4038,Thus the data is normal. We will use a T Test.

t.test(data,mu = 25)

##The P value is 0.297 thus we cannot reject the null hypothesis. Thus the mean of the data
###The mean equals to 25. Thus there is no change in the mean time.
